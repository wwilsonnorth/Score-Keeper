# Score Keeper
This application was built as part of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course.

A score keeper to track your score when playing rock, paper, scissors against friends. The default game is the first player to 5 points wins. This can be changed using the text box and the score will cap at whatever value is entered. Having built this through the course which takes you through building the functionality making it very basic, I created the design, layout and idea behind the rest of the application.
