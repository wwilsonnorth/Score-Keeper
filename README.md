# Score Keeper
A score keeper to track your points playing rock, paper, scissors against friends. This project was built as part of Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course. The course takes you through building the functionality making it very basic so I created the design, layout and idea behind the rest of the application.

HTML, CSS & JavaScript used. The default game is first player to 5 points wins which can be changed using the text box and the score will cap at whatever value is entered.
